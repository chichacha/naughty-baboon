ðŸ“… 4-4-5 calendar....

I look up 4-4-5 calendar little too often!!
So I just wanted to create reference calendar using ggplot. 

### 4-4-5? Calendar? 

A year has 52 weeks, so 52/4 = 13 weeks each for quarter. 

**4** weeks as first month of the quarter
next **4** weeks as 2nd month of the quarter
next **5** weeks as 3rd month of the quarter, and so on...


Here's little calendar for 2018 in 4-4-5 calendar format.
